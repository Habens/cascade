# Cascade

Cascade is a functional testing framework.
It allows the tester to define different steps in a workflow and then define different scenarios for each step.
When cascade runs, it calculates all the combinations using each scenario for each step and generates tests.
Because it takes advantage of how functional tests are workflow oriented, it makes writing functional tests
much easier, simpler and at the same time more comprehensive.
