TODO
4. if a general exception happens have cascade reports display as much.
15. error handling.
12. profiles
14. all strategies should be override-able via annotations.

17. transitionId and stateId should display in reports if used.
20. previous and next buttons on scope display.
26. filtering should support first result, first 10 etc.
29. print completeness level on summary page.
30. add tabs to breadcrumbs.
31. coverage page is broken.

DOCUMENTATION
24. document static variables
25. document beforeall afterall.
8. document reports
27. document parallize.
28. rename description annotation to narrative.

WONT FIX
10. test generator that drives off story files.
16. state persistence
21. scope page might be better as collapsible accordians.

DONE
1. change link on html reports page so that if you click on the cell, it goes to a test.
2. change default tab back to synopsis.
3. allow click on link so that you can easily trace where the link is going.
18. cascade reports should write to a unique directory in case of multiple control files.  directory location should be override-able via annotation.
5. add post report handler. This can load the report in chrome.
19. global setup and teardown. - we can put the browser handler in this.
19. Sort out responsive menu in first example application css - doesn't look nice in screenshots.
22. make screenshot zoom.
13. step handlers should support injectable values
6. Reflections utils doesn't like 1.8.  need to update to support lambdas
11. test parallel-lisation
23. narrative annotation - added to scope pane.
9. annotation for overriding step name.
7. test names need some work in the reports test list.

Cookbook ideas:
1. OnlyRunWith greater explanation.
2. How to run different profiles
3. Timed events - how to reduce to state machine.
4. How to use transitionId, scenarioId or stateId.
5. How to write a state rendering - general or specific.  and a transition renderer.
6. How to write a screenshot handler.
